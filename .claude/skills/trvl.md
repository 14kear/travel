## ALWAYS RUN THESE CHECKS
1. **Nearby airports** — HEL/TMP/TKU, LHR/LGW/STN, CDG/ORY/BVA, JFK/EWR
2. **One-way vs round-trip** — RT often cheaper, book RT skip return
3. **Split tickets** — different airline each direction
4. **Flex dates** — ±3 days, Tue-Wed cheapest
5. **Luggage math** — low-cost+bag vs full-service all-in
6. **Status airline preference** — if profile has FF status, prefer within 15%

| KLM/AF connections | Via AMS | 1-stop sometimes cheaper than nonstop |
| Open-jaw | Multi-city | Fly in A, out of B, save backtracking |
| Train+flight | Europe | Nearby city by train + cheaper flight |
| Bus vs train | Short haul | search_ground both, compare FlixBus vs RegioJet vs Eurostar |
